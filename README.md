# Defintion of Customer Life Time Value & Why do we need to look at CLV
    
     Customer lifetime value (CLV) is the amount of value a customer contributes to your business over their lifetime –  
     which starts with a new customer’s first purchase or contract and ends with the “moment of churn.”
     
     Understanding CLV can help your business answer these critical questions:
        1. How much can we comfortably spend on marketing and sales for customer acquisition?
        2. How much should we spend on customer service to retain an existing customer?
        3. Who are our most valuable customers and how can we better target this demographic for future sales?
        
        Remember, not all customers are equally valuable. For most businesses, a small cohort of specific customers 
        is generally the most   profitable. Assessing your CLV can allow you to dedicate more resources toward the 
        acquisition and retention of high-value customers – thereby increasing profits overall.
        
        One of the most valuable applications is using CLV to frame a better understanding of your customer acquisition cost (CAC).
        Your CLV:CAC ratio reveals a lot about the health of your business model.
