### Defintion of Customer Life Time Value & Why do we need to look at CLV
    
     Customer lifetime value (CLV) is the amount of value a customer contributes to your business over their lifetime –  
     which starts with a new customer’s first purchase or contract and ends with the “moment of churn.”
     
     Understanding CLV can help your business answer these critical questions:
        1. How much can we comfortably spend on marketing and sales for customer acquisition?
        2. How much should we spend on customer service to retain an existing customer?
        3. Who are our most valuable customers and how can we better target this demographic for future sales?
        
        Remember, not all customers are equally valuable. For most businesses, a small cohort of specific customers 
        is generally the most   profitable. Assessing your CLV can allow you to dedicate more resources toward the 
        acquisition and retention of high-value customers – thereby increasing profits overall.
        
        One of the most valuable applications is using CLV to frame a better understanding of your customer acquisition cost (CAC).
        Your CLV:CAC ratio reveals a lot about the health of your business model.

### How to Calculate Customer Lifetime Value

    Measuring CLV requires looks at 
                    the length of the customer lifespan ( How many years is customer will be with the company )
                    retention rate
                    customer churn rate
                    the average profit margins per customer.
    
    There are several different ways to calculate CLV, including the simple and traditional formulas that we’ll look at today.
    CLV can also be historic or predictive depending on the data used.
        
            Historic CLV is the sum of all profits from a customer’s past purchases. This number is based on existing customer data 
            from a specific period of time.
            
            Predictive CLV allows you to project how much revenue a customer will generate for your business over the course of the     
            customer relationship. This is considered a more complete method of assessing CLV.The predictive model uses transaction 
            history and behavioral patterns to determine the current value of a customer and to forecast how customer value will 
            evolve with time. As you collect more data to include in this calculation, the value will become increasingly accurate.
