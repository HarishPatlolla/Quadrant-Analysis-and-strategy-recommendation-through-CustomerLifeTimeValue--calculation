# Customer Life Time Value
    
     Customer lifetime value (CLV) is the amount of value a customer contributes to your business over their lifetime – \n which starts with a new customer’s first purchase or contract and ends with the “moment of churn.”
     
     Understanding CLV can help your business answer these critical questions:
        1. How much can we comfortably spend on marketing and sales for customer acquisition?
        2. How much should we spend on customer service to retain an existing customer?
        3. Who are our most valuable customers and how can we better target this demographic for future sales?
